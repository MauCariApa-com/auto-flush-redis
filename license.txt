GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 2, June 1991

Copyright (C) 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                         Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
  freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public
  License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
  softwareâ€”to make sure the software is free for all its users.

  This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
  Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit
  to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered
  by the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You can apply it
  to your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have
  the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them
  if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want
  it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free
  programs, and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone
  to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These
  restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
  distribute copies of the software or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
  gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
  freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive
  or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they
  know their rights.

  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
  (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
  giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

                         TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  0. Definitions.

  "This License" refers to version 2 of the GNU General Public License.

  "Copyright holder" is the individual, organization, or entity
  named in the copyright notice.

  "You" means someone who has received a copy of this License or
  a work based on the Program from someone else.

  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under
  this License.

  "Modifications" are works based on the Program or on another
  work based on the Program.

  "You may copy, modify, sublicense, and/or distribute the Program
  or works based on the Program under the terms of this License."

  1. Source Code.

  The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
  making modifications to it. For example, the source code of a program
  is the program's code in the programming language in which it was
  written, as well as any scripts used to control compilation and
  installation of the program. The source code is not necessarily the
  same as the compiled program.

  2. Basic Permissions.

  All rights granted under this License are granted on the condition
  that you follow the terms of this License. You may copy, modify,
  sublicense, and/or distribute the Program, or works based on it,
  under the terms of this License.

  3. Copyleft.

  You must give any other recipients of the Program or works based on
  it the same rights that you have. You must ensure that all copies
  and substantial portions of the Program include this License.

  4. Attribution.

  You must provide proper attribution to the authors of the Program
  and include a copy of the License with any substantial portion of
  the Program you distribute.

  5. Warranty.

  The Program is distributed without warranty of any kind, express or
  implied. See the GNU General Public License for more details.

  6. Limitation.

  You may not impose any additional restrictions beyond those outlined
  in this License.
